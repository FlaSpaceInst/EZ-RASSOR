Cosmic GPS
==========
Cosmic GPS refers to deriving location using the positions of stars in the sky. Because it was infeasible to accurately simulate the stars  in a simulated environment, we implemented Cosmic GPS outside of the simulation environment. Instead, we use real pictures of the night sky. Once the EZ-RASSOR software has been integrated with a physical robot, Cosmic GPS can be integrated with the rest of the project. For more information about Cosmic GPS, see the documents for the 2020 EZ-RASSOR GPS-Denied Navigation Team `here`_.

To run Cosmic GPS, run the following:
::
  python cell_gps.py

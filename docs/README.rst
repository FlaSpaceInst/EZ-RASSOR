EZ-RASSOR
---------
|build badge| |style badge|

The EZ-RASSOR (EZ Regolith Advanced Surface Systems Operations Robot) is an inexpensive, autonomous, regolith-mining robot designed to mimic the look and abilities of NASAâ€™s RASSOR on a smaller scale. The primary goal of the EZ-RASSOR is to provide a demonstration robot for visitors at the Kennedy Space Center. The EZ-RASSOR can:

- Rove across light-to-moderate terrain
- Collect regolith in rotating drums
- Return regolith to hoppers located away from dig sites
- Execute pre-planned routines
- Autonomously navigate around possible obstructions
- Cooperate in a swarm of other EZ-RASSORs

For more information, our `wiki`_ contains a high-level overview of the EZ-RASSOR and its many components.

INSTALLATION PREREQUISITES
--------------------------
- `ROS Melodic`_
- `Python 2.7`_
- `Pip`_
- `rosdep`_
- `build-essential`_

TYPICAL INSTALLATION
--------------------
First, clone this repository with ``git``.

.. code-block:: bash

    git clone https://github.com/FlaSpaceInst/EZ-RASSOR.git
    cd EZ-RASSOR 

Then, let the ``develop.sh`` script do the heavy lifting! On Ubuntu Xenial or Ubuntu Bionic, creating a catkin workspace and building all packages is achieved with these commands:

.. code-block:: bash

  # By default, all ROS packages in the *packages* folder will be installed
  sh develop.sh setup
  sh develop.sh link
  sh develop.sh resolve
  sh develop.sh build
  sh develop.sh install
  ** RESTART TERMINAL **

If you encounter ``Sub-process /usr/bin/dpkg returned an error code...``, try to fix the broken install with the following command, then rerun the original command:

.. code-block:: bash

  sudo apt --fix-broken install
  ** RERUN ORIGINAL COMMAND **
  
Everything's installed now! Proceed to the `usage`_ section.

CUSTOMIZED INSTALLATION
-----------------------
If you want to install specific EZ-RASSOR packages, you can use the same develop.sh script:

Make sure you have already run the setup command at least once:

.. code-block:: bash

  sh develop.sh setup

Then, you can call the relink function and use ``-o`` to pass in the package name(s) you would like to install:

.. code-block:: bash

  sh develop.sh relink -o ezrassor_sim_control ezrassor_sim_description ezrassor_sim_gazebo
  sh develop.sh build
  sh develop.sh install
  
Alternatively, you can also call the relink function and use the ``-e`` flag to make the script install all *but* the specified package(s):

.. code-block:: bash

  sh develop.sh relink -e ezrassor_swarm_control

WINDOWS 10 CONFIGURATION
------------------------

First, set up and install WSL2 on Windows 10 from `Microsoft's tutorial`_. Make sure to install Ubuntu 18.04 from the `Microsoft Store`_.

Next, follow the steps in the `typical installation`_ section.

Before you can run the simulation, VcXsrv needs to be installed and configured so that WSL2 can launch GUI applications in your environment. 

* `Install VcXsrv`_ and run the XLaunch program.
* Select multiple windows, set display number to -1 and click next.
* Select Start no client and click next.
* Keep Clipboard and Primary Selection checked, uncheck Native opengl, check Disable access control and click next.
* Save configuration (optional) and click finish.

You should now see XLaunch running in the background on the bottom right of your task bar.

To test if GUI applications are properly displaying in your WSL2 environment in Ubuntu 18.04:

.. code-block:: bash

  sudo apt install mesa-utils
  glxgears

A window should now pop-up with a set of RGB gears turning smoothly. If the gears are not smoothly turning or frames are noticeably skipping, refer to the top answer from Superuser for `troubleshooting OpenGL on Ubuntu`_.

Everything should be ready to go! Continue to the `usage`_ section.

USAGE
-----
The EZ-RASSOR is controlled via a collection of *launch files*. These files contain lists of commands that start up the robot's systems and the simulation environment. They are read, understood, and executed by a core ROS utility called ``roslaunch``, whose general syntax is as follows:

.. code-block:: bash

  roslaunch <package> <launch file> [arguments...]
  
Each launch file is located in one of our packages, and the most important launch files are located in the ``ezrassor_launcher`` package. To learn more about a specific launch file, visit that launch file's package's `wiki`_ page (via the navigation menu on the right). Here are some example commands that show launch files in action:

.. code-block:: bash

  # Launch the simulation with a single robot controlled by the mobile app.
  roslaunch ezrassor_launcher configurable_simulation.launch control_methods:=app
  
  # Launch the simulation with a single robot controlled by an autonomous loop.
  roslaunch ezrassor_launcher configurable_simulation.launch control_methods:=autonomy
  
  # Launch the simulation with two robots, both controlled by gamepads, on the moon.
  roslaunch ezrassor_launcher configurable_simulation.launch \
      control_methods:=gamepad \
      world:=moon \
      robot_count:=2 \
      joysticks:="0 1" \
      spawn_x_coords:="-1 1" \
      spawn_y_coords:="1 -1"
      
  # Launch the communication system in dual mode: manual and autonomous control together.
  roslaunch ezrassor_launcher configurable_communication.launch control_methods:="app gamepad autonomy"
  
Please read the `wiki page for the ezrassor_launcher`_ to learn more about what the main launch files can do.

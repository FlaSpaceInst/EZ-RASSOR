EZ-RASSOR

|build badge| |style badge|

The EZ-RASSOR (EZ Regolith Advanced Surface Systems Operations Robot) is an inexpensive, autonomous, regolith-mining robot designed to mimic the look and abilities of NASAâ€™s RASSOR on a smaller scale. The primary goal of the EZ-RASSOR is to provide a demonstration robot for visitors at the Kennedy Space Center. The EZ-RASSOR can:

- Rove across light-to-moderate terrain
- Collect regolith in rotating drums
- Return regolith to hoppers located away from dig sites
- Execute pre-planned routines
- Autonomously navigate around possible obstructions
- Cooperate in a swarm of other EZ-RASSORs

For more information, our `wiki`_ contains a high-level overview of the EZ-RASSOR and its many components.

INSTALLATION PREREQUISITES
--------------------------
- `ROS Melodic`_
- `Python 2.7`_
- `Pip`_
- `rosdep`_
- `build-essential`_

TYPICAL INSTALLATION
--------------------
First, clone this repository with ``git``.

.. code-block:: bash

    git clone https://github.com/FlaSpaceInst/EZ-RASSOR.git
    cd EZ-RASSOR 

Then, let the ``develop.sh`` script do the heavy lifting! On Ubuntu Xenial or Ubuntu Bionic, creating a catkin workspace and building all packages is achieved with these commands:

.. code-block:: bash

  # By default, all ROS packages in the *packages* folder will be installed
  sh develop.sh setup
  sh develop.sh link
  sh develop.sh resolve
  sh develop.sh build
  sh develop.sh install
  ** RESTART TERMINAL **

If you encounter ``Sub-process /usr/bin/dpkg returned an error code...``, try to fix the broken install with the following command, then rerun the original command:

.. code-block:: bash

  sudo apt --fix-broken install
  ** RERUN ORIGINAL COMMAND **
  
Everything's installed now! Proceed to the `usage`_ section.

CUSTOMIZED INSTALLATION
-----------------------
If you want to install specific EZ-RASSOR packages, you can use the same develop.sh script:

Make sure you have already run the setup command at least once:

.. code-block:: bash

  sh develop.sh setup

Then, you can call the relink function and use ``-o`` to pass in the package name(s) you would like to install:

.. code-block:: bash

  sh develop.sh relink -o ezrassor_sim_control ezrassor_sim_description ezrassor_sim_gazebo
  sh develop.sh build
  sh develop.sh install
  
Alternatively, you can also call the relink function and use the ``-e`` flag to make the script install all *but* the specified package(s):

.. code-block:: bash

  sh develop.sh relink -e ezrassor_swarm_control
  
USAGE
-----
The EZ-RASSOR is controlled via a collection of *launch files*. These files contain lists of commands that start up the robot's systems and the simulation environment. They are read, understood, and executed by a core ROS utility called ``roslaunch``, whose general syntax is as follows:

.. code-block:: bash

  roslaunch <package> <launch file> [arguments...]
  
Each launch file is located in one of our packages, and the most important launch files are located in the ``ezrassor_launcher`` package. To learn more about a specific launch file, visit that launch file's package's `wiki`_ page (via the navigation menu on the right). Here are some example commands that show launch files in action:

.. code-block:: bash

  # Launch the simulation with a single robot controlled by the mobile app.
  roslaunch ezrassor_launcher configurable_simulation.launch control_methods:=app
  
  # Launch the simulation with a single robot controlled by an autonomous loop.
  roslaunch ezrassor_launcher configurable_simulation.launch control_methods:=autonomy
  
  # Launch the simulation with two robots, both controlled by gamepads, on the moon.
  roslaunch ezrassor_launcher configurable_simulation.launch \
      control_methods:=gamepad \
      world:=moon \
      robot_count:=2 \
      joysticks:="0 1" \
      spawn_x_coords:="-1 1" \
      spawn_y_coords:="1 -1"
      
  # Launch the communication system in dual mode: manual and autonomous control together.
  roslaunch ezrassor_launcher configurable_communication.launch control_methods:="app gamepad autonomy"
  
Please read the `wiki page for the ezrassor_launcher`_ to learn more about what the main launch files can do.

    A "leader key" is the most recently-pressed key that is still pressed
    after any given event, or None if no key is pressed.

    Example key event sequence and corresponding generated sequence:
        press "a"     :   yield "a"
        press "b"     :   yield "b"
        release "b"   :   yield "a"

        release "a"   :
        release "c"   :   yield None

    The point of this generator is to filter out repeated events for keys that
    remain pressed for a long time, and also maintain state when multiple keys
    are pressed and held in a sequence.
